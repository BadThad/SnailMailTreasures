This week started off with the entire group looking at github merge reviews
From now on, we are going to ask everyone for a review during pull requests
We also discused what kind of components that we needed for our project.

We decide what components that we wanted to work on. I decided to work on the login/registration component.
We also agreed on color scheme and layout.
