This week I worked on both the navbar and the footer components. I fixed layout issues and added mobile-friendly styling to make sure they look good across screen sizes. I also practiced using Git more confidently—especially pull requests and syncing branches. Even though the project is slightly behind, I’m staying focused and contributing where I can to help the frontend come together.
